                             --- IMPORTANT ---
       This is an extension for AV-Server v1.3 that can be found in
   the package 'avserv04.lzh'. For installation instructions and further
    information refere to the original documentation that can be found
                      in the package mentioned above ...


AVSRV04L.LZH contains AV-Server 1.3-L. This "L" version is identical to the
"regular" release version 1.3 of AV-Server (avserv04.lzh) except that it
has a bigger internal memory pool and therefore can deal with up to 64 AV
clients and 127 client windows (the "L" stands for "large").

If you do not need this high limits, I recomend to use the regular release
Version 1.3 of AV-Server or newer.

Installation: replace the binary 'avserver.app' (after making a back up!)
with the one included in this L-package and restart. That's all, enjoy!


Confused by the two different binary files named 'avserver.app'? Version
1.3 "regular" is 21.282 Bytes, the 1.3-L "large" is 21.286 Bytes. (You can
also use the UN*X-Tool 'what' to identify the two versions).
